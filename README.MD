RSS-to-Email Tech Blog Notifier – Built a Python service that monitors multiple engineering and security blogs via RSS and sends Gmail notifications only for new posts, avoiding duplicates by tracking previously seen items in a local store. Integrated feedparser for robust RSS parsing and Gmail SMTP with app passwords for secure delivery, driven by environment variables instead of hardcoded secrets. Automated periodic execution using Windows Task Scheduler, making the system fully unattended while remaining lightweight and privacy‑preserving (no third‑party RSS or email services).
